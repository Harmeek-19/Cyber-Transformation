# AWS Security Architecture Demos - CLI Commands Used

## üìã Commands Used in Live Demonstrations

This document contains **only** the CLI commands actually used in the 7 AWS Security Architecture demos, organized by demonstration sequence.

---

## üîß Demo 1: Account Security Foundation

### Commands Used:

| Command | Purpose | Demo Context |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `aws configure` | Configure AWS CLI with admin user credentials | Set up CLI access with admin user (not root) |
| `aws sts get-caller-identity` | Verify current user identity | Confirm we're using admin user, not root account |
| `aws configure list` | Display current configuration | Show CLI is properly configured with correct user |

### Expected Outputs:
- **`aws sts get-caller-identity`** should show admin user ARN, not root
- **`aws configure list`** should show admin user access key and us-east-1 region

---

## üë• Demo 2: IAM Permission Control

### Commands Used:

| Command | Purpose | Demo Context |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `aws configure --profile test-user` | Configure CLI profile for test user | Set up test user credentials for permission testing |
| `aws s3 ls --profile test-user` | Test S3 access with test user | Initially fails (no permissions), later succeeds after policy attachment |
| `aws iam list-users --profile test-user` | Test IAM access with test user | Succeeds after adding to iamreadonly group |
| `aws ec2 describe-instances --profile test-user` | Test EC2 access with test user | Always fails (proves least privilege working) |

### Permission Testing Flow:
1. **No permissions:** `aws s3 ls --profile test-user` ‚Üí Access Denied ‚ùå
2. **After IAM group:** `aws iam list-users --profile test-user` ‚Üí Success ‚úÖ
3. **After S3 policy:** `aws s3 ls --profile test-user` ‚Üí Success ‚úÖ
4. **EC2 still blocked:** `aws ec2 describe-instances --profile test-user` ‚Üí Access Denied ‚ùå

## üé´ Demo 3: IAM Roles & Service Authentication

### Commands Used:

| Command | Purpose | Demo Context |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `aws configure --profile neil2` | Configure CLI for role assumption testing | Set up user with no direct permissions |
| `aws s3 ls --profile neil2` | Test S3 access without role | Shows access denied before role assumption |
| `aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:role/iamroletests3 --role-session-name test-session --profile neil2` | Assume role to gain S3 access | Get temporary credentials with S3 permissions |
| `aws s3 ls` | Test S3 access with assumed role | Works after assuming role (using temporary credentials) |
| `aws s3 ls` | Test S3 access from EC2 instance | Demonstrates automatic role assumption by EC2 |
| `aws ec2 describe-instances` | Test EC2 access from EC2 instance | Fails because role doesn't include EC2 permissions |
| `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/iamroleec2s3` | Show temporary credentials | Display auto-rotating credentials from EC2 metadata |

Yes ‚Äî the command must be run with the IP 169.254.169.254 only.

‚úÖ Why?
This IP is hardcoded by AWS as the endpoint for the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). It‚Äôs a special internal IP that only works inside an EC2 instance. You cannot replace it with the instance‚Äôs public or private IP.

üîê What Happens When You Run It?
When you run:


The EC2 instance connects to the metadata service running at that IP.
It fetches temporary credentials for the IAM role named iamroleec2s3.
üß† Quick Analogy
Think of 169.254.169.254 like a local help desk inside your EC2 instance. It‚Äôs always there, always at the same address, and only your instance can talk to it.

### Role Flow Demonstration:
1. **Before role:** `aws s3 ls --profile neil2` ‚Üí Access Denied ‚ùå
2. **Assume role:** Get temporary credentials from assume-role command
3. **With role:** `aws s3 ls` ‚Üí Success ‚úÖ (using exported temporary credentials)
4. **From EC2:** `aws s3 ls` ‚Üí Success ‚úÖ (automatic role assumption)
5. **EC2 limits:** `aws ec2 describe-instances` ‚Üí Access Denied ‚ùå (role boundary working)

## üåê Demo 4: VPC Network Architecture

### Commands Used:

| Command | Purpose | Demo Context |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `aws ec2 describe-vpcs --vpc-ids $VPC_ID` | Show VPC details | Display custom VPC configuration after creation |
| `aws ec2 describe-subnets --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"` | Show subnet details | Display public and private subnets in custom VPC |
| `aws ec2 describe-route-tables --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"` | Show routing configuration | Display route tables and internet gateway routes |
| `aws ec2 describe-internet-gateways --filters "Name=attachment.vpc-id,Values=$VPC_ID"` | Show internet gateway | Verify internet gateway is attached to VPC |

### Network Verification Flow:
- **VPC:** Shows custom CIDR block (10.0.0.0/16)
- **Subnets:** Shows public (10.0.1.0/24) and private (10.0.2.0/24) subnets
- **Routes:** Shows internet gateway route for public subnet only
- **Gateway:** Shows internet gateway attached and available

| `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids $SG_ID` | Show security group rules | Display SSH access restricted to admin IP only |
| `aws ec2 describe-network-acls --network-acl-ids $CUSTOM_NACL_ID` | Show network ACL rules | Display subnet-level firewall rules |

### Security Validation:
- **IP Discovery:** Shows current public IP for firewall rules

## üéØ Demo 7: Complete End-to-End Validation

### Commands Used (from within EC2 instance):

| Command | Purpose | Demo Context |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `aws s3 ls` | Test S3 access from EC2 | Should work - role allows S3 read access |
| `aws s3api list-buckets` | Test detailed S3 operations | Should work - demonstrates S3 permissions |
| `aws ec2 describe-instances` | Test EC2 management from EC2 | Should fail - role doesn't include EC2 permissions |
| `aws iam list-users` | Test IAM access from EC2 | Should fail - role doesn't include IAM permissions |
| `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/iamroleec2s3` | Show instance credentials | Display temporary, auto-rotating credentials |
| `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/iamroleec2s3 | grep Expiration` | Show credential expiration | Display when credentials expire (6-hour rotation) |
| `ls -la ~/.aws/` | Check for credential files | Should show no files - proves no hardcoded credentials |
| `env | grep -i aws` | Check environment variables | Should show no AWS variables - proves no hardcoded credentials |

### Complete Validation Results:

| Test Category | Command | Expected Result | Security Proof |
|---------------|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Allowed Operations** | `aws s3 ls` | ‚úÖ Success | Role permissions working |
| **Allowed Operations** | `aws s3api list-buckets` | ‚úÖ Success | S3 access confirmed |
| **Blocked Operations** | `aws ec2 describe-instances` | ‚ùå Access Denied | Permission boundary enforced |
| **Blocked Operations** | `aws iam list-users` | ‚ùå Access Denied | Least privilege working |
| **Credential Security** | `ls -la ~/.aws/` | No files found | No hardcoded credentials |
| **Credential Security** | `env \| grep -i aws` | No variables | No environment credentials |
| **Auto-Rotation** | `curl ...security-credentials...` | Shows expiration | Credentials expire automatically |

## üéØ Key Command Patterns in Demos

### **Progressive Permission Testing:**
1. Start with no permissions ‚Üí Access Denied
2. Add group membership ‚Üí Some access granted  
3. Add custom policy ‚Üí Additional access granted
4. Test boundaries ‚Üí Other services still denied

### **Role-Based Authentication:**
1. Direct user access ‚Üí Fails without permissions
2. Assume role ‚Üí Temporary access granted
3. EC2 automatic assumption ‚Üí Seamless service access
4. Permission boundaries ‚Üí Only specific services allowed

### **Security Verification:**
1. Network access ‚Üí SSH from authorized IP only
2. Service permissions ‚Üí Only S3 read access works
3. Credential security ‚Üí No hardcoded keys found
4. Automatic rotation ‚Üí Credentials expire and refresh

## üìù Notes for Demo Execution

### **Variable Usage:**
- Replace `$VPC_ID`, `$SG_ID`, `$INSTANCE_ID` with actual values during demos
- Replace `ACCOUNT-ID` with your actual AWS account ID
- Replace `--profile` names with your configured profile names

### **Expected Failures:**
- Many commands are **supposed to fail** to demonstrate security boundaries
- Access Denied errors are **positive results** showing security is working
- Missing credential files are **good signs** showing no hardcoded keys

### **Success Indicators:**
- `aws sts get-caller-identity` showing admin user (not root)
- S3 commands working when permissions allow
- EC2/IAM commands failing when permissions deny
- Temporary credentials showing expiration times

Perfect! I can see exactly what's happening. Your setup is working correctly, but there are two issues:

## **üéØ Great News: Your Setup is Working!**

Looking at your output, I can see:

1. **‚úÖ IAM Role is attached:** `"IamInstanceProfile": { "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::733366527973:instance-profile/iamroletestingec2s3"`
2. **‚úÖ S3 access works:** `aws s3 ls` successfully listed your buckets
3. **‚úÖ No hardcoded credentials:** The role is providing access automatically

## **üîç Two Issues to Fix:**

### **Issue 1: IMDSv2 is Required**

In your instance metadata, I see:
```json
"HttpTokens": "required"
```

This means your instance requires **IMDSv2** (Instance Metadata Service version 2), which needs a token for security.

### **Issue 2: Wrong Role Name in URL**

Your instance profile is named `iamroletestingec2s3`, but you need to check what the actual **role name** is inside that profile.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Solutions:**

### **Step 1: Use IMDSv2 to Access Metadata**

SSH back into your EC2 instance and run:

```bash
# Get a token first (required for IMDSv2)
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600" -s)

# Check if we got a token
echo "Token received: $TOKEN"

# Use token to get available credential names
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
```

This should return the actual role name.

### **Step 2: Get the Credentials**

Once you get the role name from Step 1, use it:

```bash
# Use the actual role name returned from previous command
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/[ACTUAL-ROLE-NAME]
```

### **Step 3: Check Instance Profile Contents (From Local Machine)**

From your Windows machine, check what role is actually in the instance profile:

```powershell
aws iam get-instance-profile --instance-profile-name iamroletestingec2s3
```

This will show you the exact role name inside the instance profile.

## **üéØ For Your Demo - Working Commands:**

Here's what you should use in your presentation:

```bash
# SSH into EC2 instance
ssh -i myfirstkey.pem ec2-user@34.207.250.126

# Show S3 access works (this proves the role is working)
aws s3 ls

# Show no hardcoded credentials
ls -la ~/.aws/
env | grep -i aws

# Get metadata token (required for this instance)
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600" -s)

# Show available credentials
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/

# Get actual credentials (use role name from above)
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/[ROLE-NAME]

# Test permission boundaries
aws ec2 describe-instances  # Should fail
aws iam list-users          # Should fail
```

## **üí° Key Demo Points:**

### **What's Working Perfectly:**
1. **‚úÖ Role attachment:** Instance profile is properly attached
2. **‚úÖ S3 access:** `aws s3 ls` works without any credential files
3. **‚úÖ Security:** No hardcoded credentials anywhere
4. **‚úÖ IMDSv2:** Your instance is using the more secure metadata service

### **For Your Presentation:**
> *"Notice that S3 access works perfectly even though we have no credential files. The IAM role provides temporary, auto-rotating credentials that are managed entirely by AWS. This instance is also using IMDSv2, which is the more secure version of the metadata service that requires token-based authentication."*

## **üöÄ Demo Script:**

```bash
# 1. Show S3 works
aws s3 ls
echo "‚úÖ S3 access working with IAM role"

# 2. Show no credentials stored
ls -la ~/.aws/ 2>/dev/null || echo "‚úÖ No credential files found"
env | grep -i aws || echo "‚úÖ No AWS environment variables"

# 3. Show temporary credentials (with IMDSv2)
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600" -s)
echo "Role name available:"
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/

# 4. Show permission boundaries work
aws ec2 describe-instances && echo "‚ùå This should have failed!" || echo "‚úÖ EC2 access properly denied"
```

Your setup is actually working perfectly - you just need to use IMDSv2 to access the metadata!
